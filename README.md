# wyspa - just a little anonymity
A Node.js bot for sending anonymous messages in Discord channels.
This is a very early project, so nothing's here.
This project won't make you fully anonymous, since it's still a Discord bot.

# A little notice
This project uses GPL v3, so users of this software cannot be bound to anything more than its contents.
However, it is hoped that all users of this software, if any, would not use it for evil. Love God, love neighbor: from this, all commandments flow.
